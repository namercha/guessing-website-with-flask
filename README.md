## Guessing a number website
This website uses Flask to ask the suer to guess a number by a route in the address bar.

Examples:
```
127.0.0.1/5000/8
127.0.0.1/5000/3
```
If the guess is too low, it says "Too Low."
If guess is too high, it says "Too High."
If guess is correct, it says "You found me!"
